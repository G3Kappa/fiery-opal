Skyrim-Style Overworld Dungeons
	- Mostly caves, sometimes decorated or made into proper fortresses and temples.

	TERRAIN
	- Long tunnels that mostly wind around one path
	- Tunnels may be blocked by mechanical gates that open after completing a puzzle
	- Some areas might contain traps
	- Stairs to next floor are at the end of the path
	- Progression is linear, each floor and its puzzles are self-contained
	- Large naturally shaped rooms, usually furnished according to a theme
	- Secret areas accessible by unlocking a mechanism (may require item found elsewhere in the world)
	- Generic loot is mostly from small chests, bags and corpses
	- End area contains a powerful (lich?) boss and awesome rewards, usually unobtainable otherwise (powers?)

	PUZZLES
	- Three Pedestals: The player will face a closed gate and three pedestals will be the dominant element of the room.
	Each pedestal will display a symbol and will rotate upon interaction, changing the displayed symbol.
	A lever will be placed in front of the pedestals and, when pulled, if the three pedestals match a pre-defined pattern, the gate will open.
	If the pedestals don't match the pattern, a trap may be triggered and potentially harm the player.
	The player may obtain clues about this puzzle in two ways: by reading books and notes scattered around the previously explored areas,
	or by looking for etchings on the walls (which are only visible in first person mode).

	- Weird Keyhole: The player will face a closed gate with a weirdly shaped keyhole in it.
	The key is a small artifact that may be held by a particular enemy or hidden in a safe location.
	Either way, it will always be within the player's reach, and within the (so-far explored) dungeon.
	This puzzle doesn't require much clue hunting, but it may prompt the player to explore and backtrack more.
	Furthermore, if the key is held by a strong enemy, it may force the player to fight it or leave the dungeon instead of simply trying to ignore or kite it.

	- Three Levers: This puzzle is a classic "perform the sequence" puzzle.
	Again, a gate will be blocking the way. This time, three levers will be
	placed on a nearby wall. The player will have to pull them in a particular order
	and the gate will open. This puzzle is otherwise very similar to the three-pedestals puzzle.

	- Pressure Plate Path: The player will enter a large room, each tile of the floor being a pressure plate.
	Most pressure plates will trigger a trap that directly injures the player, but there exists a path through which one
	can pass unscathed. Clues regarding this puzzle may be written in a cryptic manner as to mislead the player into the wrong path.
	(ref. We Were Here)

	- Mirrors and Lasers: The player will enter a large room. There will be a lever that, when pulled,
	will activate a sizzling laser. This laser can be redirected by moving (by bumping into) and rotating (by interacting with)
	some pedestals with mirrors on top of them. Moving into the laser will harm the player, so it's best to power it off when moving the pedestals.
	When the laser finally hits a specific wall tile, the puzzle will be completed and the gate will open.

	SECRET PUZZLES
	Secret puzzles are not designed to be unlocked in a linear fashion, some even requiring the player to leave the dungeon and backtrack.

	- Passphrase Puzzle: A gate may ask for a pass phrase, and the player will have to type in an answer.
	In order to solve this puzzle, the player must look around for clues about this specific dungeon.
	Some information sources are books, gossip and journals taken from other explorers.
	Once they know the passphrase, they'll be able to return to the gate and open it.

	ENEMIES
	Enemies depend on the theme of the dungeon.

	- Cultists: Some cultists have made this cave their meeting place. The upper levels will contain lower-level cultists,
	while the lower levels will contain strong foes capable of mighty invocations and sorcery.
	The final boss is nothing less than a hellish fiend summoned from another dimension.

	- Bandits: Some bandits have made this cave their refuge. The upper levels will contain the newer recruits,
	while the lower levels will contain battle-worn mercenaries and sneaky thieves.
	The final boss is a gang of strong bandits fought inside an arena-like environment that connects to a vault of stolen and pillaged goods.

	- Beasts: Time has worn this place down, breaking some of its inner machinations. Beasts readily settled in, making it their lair.
	The upper levels will contain beasts such as bats, rats, foxes and moles, while the lower levels will be home to much less mundane creatures.
	The final boss is a dragon who has settled in the deepest reaches of the cave and guards a vault full of gold and riches.
