ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

In Fiery Opal, the player doesn't learn to exploit the game. Instead, the game learns to exploit the player.
Artificial Intelligence is handled by neural networks, such that creatures may adapt to their environment.

Since having a simulated brain for every single creature would obviously pose serious scaling problems, the "Overmind" approach is taken instead.

THE OVERMIND
Each species, or particular class of creature has its own hivemind, or "Overmind".
Essentially, this works like system virtualization: each creature borrows resources and processing power from the same machine,
but this particular machine learns too. The architecture originates from the following diagram:
