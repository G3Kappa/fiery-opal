"Long before Man, in a place no more tangible than a God's wakeful dream,
the swirling forces of destruction and creation were chaotic and powerful.
Sundering the void, new realities were constantly being spawned, but they would
annihilate each other before developing any further. As time inexhorably moved
forward, the primordial forces got weaker, and some realities were finally allowed to be."

When our world came into being, it was ruled by chaos too; at first it refused
to mold itself into any shape, and no law or axiom could persist. But as it grew
older, it slowly and unevenly consolidated into its present form. Today, some pockets
of the energy driving that process can still be found in what we call the Fiery Opal.

This most peculiar gem blazes with a rainbow of colors as light is shone through
its polished body. It has been observed that the intricate patterns it produces
shift and distort over time, and the frequency at which notable shifts occur has
been correlated to the raw power of the gem. Despite having been a magical source
for ages, sought and bled over by kingdoms and empires, not much is known about it.

The Opal is a very scarce resource, and common folk don't usually own any.
Even the weaker stones are in very high demand, and the presence of an extensive 
black market for them has been known to play a large role in foreign politics.
The larger stones are disputed between kingdoms, and each kingdom uses them
according to their philosophy - either for war and devastation or for prosperity and peace.

But legends tell of the ultimate gem, so pure and untouched by the tides of time
that whomever gains possession of it shall know the power of a God. Countless
adventurers have spent their life looking for it, yet its whereabouts are still
shrouded in mystery."
